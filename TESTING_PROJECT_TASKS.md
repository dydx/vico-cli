## Task Prioritization Criteria

Tasks have been prioritized based on:

1. **Foundation First**: Components that other parts of the system depend on
2. **Coverage Impact**: Areas with no current test coverage
3. **Complexity**: Starting with simpler components to establish patterns
4. **Risk Level**: Higher priority for critical authentication and data handling
5. **Maintainability**: Higher priority for areas likely to change frequently

## Testing Goals

- Achieve at least 80% overall code coverage
- Ensure all critical path functions have 100% coverage
- Use table-driven tests for all testable components
- Include both happy path and edge case testing
- Create reusable test helpers and mocks for API testing
- Document test patterns for future development
