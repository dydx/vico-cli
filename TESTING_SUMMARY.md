# Testing Summary

## What Has Been Done

1. **Command Test Structure Implemented**:
   - Created test utilities in `testutils` package:
     - `ExecuteCommandCapturingOutput`: Captures stdout/stderr during command execution
     - `ResetCommandFlags`: Resets command flags between tests
     - `CreateTestCommand`: Utility for creating test commands
     - Mock HTTP client for simulating API responses
   - Added mocking capability to the `auth` package:
     - `MockAuthenticate`: Replaces the authentication function for testing
     - Made HTTP client configurable for tests
   - Implemented partial testing of commands:
     - Root command tests (help, version)
     - Flag parsing tests
     - Error handling tests (partial)

2. **Test Coverage Status**:
   - High coverage in utility packages:
     - `pkg/cache`: 94.1% coverage
     - `pkg/output`: 100.0% coverage
     - `pkg/output/stdout`: 93.3% coverage
   - Moderate coverage in core components:
     - `pkg/auth`: 72.7% coverage
     - `cmd`: 57.1% coverage
   - Lower coverage in command implementations:
     - `cmd/devices`: 23.2% coverage
     - `cmd/events`: 32.8% coverage

3. **Tests Currently Skipped**:
   - Command tests that require mockable functions:
     - Device command tests (list, get)
     - Event command tests (list, get, search)
   - Error handling tests that need updated error messages
   - Completion tests with file handling issues

## What's Next

1. **Make Functions Mockable**:
   - The main limitation is that command functions are not currently mockable
   - Need to refactor functions like `listDevices`, `getDevice`, etc., to be variable functions
   - This will allow proper mocking in tests

2. **Fix Error Handling Tests**:
   - Update error message expectations to match actual Cobra output
   - Implement proper error handling in commands

3. **Complete Command Testing**:
   - Once functions are mockable, re-enable skipped tests
   - Add additional test cases for edge conditions

4. **Increase Test Coverage**:
   - Focus on the command implementation packages
   - Add tests for untested error conditions

5. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Implement CLI output tests
   - Test environment variable handling
   - Test error messaging

## Overall Assessment

The test suite has a solid foundation, with excellent coverage in the utility packages. The main challenge is in the command implementations, which will require refactoring to make them testable. Once these changes are made, the existing test infrastructure should allow for comprehensive testing of the CLI.

The testing approach using mocks and test utilities is effective and will scale well as the codebase grows. The table-driven test pattern is being used consistently, which makes tests easier to maintain and extend.

## Current Coverage Gaps

1. **Command Execution Logic**: 
   - The actual command execution flows aren't fully tested due to mockability issues

2. **Flag Handling Logic**:
   - Some flag validation and handling is not fully tested

3. **Integration Flows**:
   - End-to-end CLI execution isn't tested yet
   - Currently relying on unit tests for individual components
