# vicohome-api

Using AI assistants and JADX, I've started compiling an OpenAPI spec for the vicohome.io API.

The Redoc site is available here: [https://dydx.github.io/vicohome-api/](https://dydx.github.io/vicohome-api/)

This is a work in progress. If you find anything wrong in my docs, make a PR fixing it and I'll gladly pull it in!
