```

## Error Codes
- `400`: Invalid request parameters
- `401`: Invalid verification code
- `409`: Email/phone already registered
- `410`: Verification code expired
- `500`: Server error

## Registration Process Flow
1. User enters email/phone and password
2. App calls `/account/registconfirm` to send verification code
3. User enters verification code
4. User enters desired display name
5. App calls `/account/register/` with all information
6. On success, user is logged in automatically

## Usage in App
This endpoint is used during the user registration process. The app first collects the user's email or phone, then requests a verification code through the `/account/registconfirm` endpoint. Once the user enters the verification code and completes the registration form, this endpoint is called to create the account.

Upon successful registration, the app:
1. Stores the authentication token for subsequent API calls
2. Automatically logs the user in
3. Navigates to the main application interface

## Error Handling
In the app, error responses are handled by checking the response's code:
- If code = 0, the registration was successful
- Otherwise, appropriate error messages are displayed based on the code and message

## Security Considerations
- This endpoint handles sensitive user information
- Passwords should meet security requirements (minimum length, complexity)
- The verification code has a limited validity period
- All communication should be over HTTPS
