# Doorbell Audition Endpoint Discovery

## Endpoint Information
- **Path:** `/device/mechanical/dingdong/audition`
- **Method:** POST
- **Base URL:** https://api-us.vicohome.io
- **Description:** Triggers a test sound for the mechanical chime feature on compatible doorbell devices

## Request Parameters
The endpoint takes a `CommonSNRequest` object in the request body:

```json
{
  "serialNumber": "string",    // Required: Device serial number
  "app": {                     // Standard BaseEntry fields
    "type": "string",          // Application type identifier
    "version": "string"        // Application version
  },
  "countryNo": "string",       // User's country code
  "language": "string",        // User's language preference 
  "tenantId": "string"         // User's tenant ID
}
```

## Response Format
The endpoint returns a standard `BaseResponse` object:

```json
{
  "result": 0,           // Result code (0 indicates success)
  "msg": "string"        // Response message
}
```

## Code Analysis
The endpoint is implemented in API interfaces:

Example call signature from decompiled code:
```java
@POST("/device/mechanical/dingdong/audition")
Observable<BaseResponse> doorBellDingDongAudition(@Body CommonSNRequest request);
```

Implementation in the application:
```java
public void doorBellDingDongAudition(String serialNumber, final Callback<BaseResponse> callback) {
    CommonSNRequest request = new CommonSNRequest();
    request.setSerialNumber(serialNumber);
    
    apiClient.doorBellDingDongAudition(request)
        .compose(ApplySchedulers.io_main())
        .subscribe(new Observer<BaseResponse>() {
            @Override
            public void onNext(BaseResponse response) {
                if (response.getResult() < 0) {
                    if (callback != null) {
                        callback.onError(response.getResult(), response.getMsg());
                    }
                    return;
                }
                
                if (callback != null) {
                    callback.onSuccess(response);
                }
            }
            
            @Override
            public void onError(Throwable e) {
                if (callback != null) {
                    callback.onError(-1, e.getMessage());
                }
            }
            
            // Other observer methods
        });
}
```

## Usage Context
This endpoint is used in the following scenarios:
1. When a user wants to test the mechanical chime sound of a doorbell device
2. In the doorbell settings screen of the application
3. As part of configuring the doorbell notification settings

The typical user flow:
1. User navigates to device settings â†’ Doorbell settings
2. User configures the mechanical chime settings (enable/disable, duration)
3. User taps an "Audition" or "Test" button
4. App calls this endpoint to trigger a test chime on the device
5. The doorbell device plays the mechanical chime sound

## Device Compatibility
This feature is only available on devices that support mechanical doorbell chimes, typically checked via:
```java
device.isSupportMechanicalDingDong()
```

It's primarily used with devices that have a charging mode of 1, which appears to indicate doorbells with wired power connections.

## UI Implementation
The UI for this feature is implemented in `RingtoneSettingFragment` which:
1. Displays doorbell configuration options
2. Provides an audition button for testing the chime
3. Shows an animation during the audition process
4. Updates based on the response from this endpoint

## Error Handling
The response follows standard error handling:
- Success is indicated by `result: 0`
- Errors are indicated by negative result codes with error messages
- Network errors are handled through the RxJava Observable pattern

When the request fails, the UI:
1. Displays an error message
2. Stops the animation on the audition button
3. Returns to the ready state for another attempt

## Notes
- This endpoint is part of the doorbell configuration system
- It allows users to hear how the mechanical chime will sound before saving settings
- The endpoint simply triggers the test sound; other endpoints handle saving actual configuration
- The feature is designed for doorbell devices that can trigger a physical, mechanical chime
- This is likely separate from digital notification sounds
- The endpoint requires only the device serial number to identify which doorbell should play the test sound
